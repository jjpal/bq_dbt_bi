Uplimit Analytics Engineering with dbt course covers, dbt fundamentals, the modern data stack, analytics engineering as a career/skillset, and data modeling best practices.	

[Update]

I initially worked with the datasets when I took the Uplimit Analytics Engineering with dbt course. Back then, we utilized gitpod, postgres, and dbt. 
Redesigned the dbt project to incorporate dbt core and the BigQuery adapter.
I set up a Google Cloud Storage bucket for the datasets, wrote a script to build the schema, and loaded the data into BigQuery.
Refactored the initial models I developed during the course, included additional tables for data augmentation, and additional data mart.

The tables included in the project are below:

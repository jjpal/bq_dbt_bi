# Welcome to the Greenery+ dbt project!

I initially worked with these datasets when I took the Uplimit Analytics Engineering with dbt course. Back then, we utilized gitpod, postgres, and dbt. 

I'm currently revamping the dbt project to incorporate dbt core and the BigQuery adapter.

I set up a Google Cloud Storage bucket for the datasets, wrote a script to build the schema, and loaded the data into BigQuery.

Additionally, I'm reorganizing the initial models I developed during the course. To begin, I introduced a new reviews table and a sales tax CSV file along with a few others in the seed folder.

The tables included in the project are below:
